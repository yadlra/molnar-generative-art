## Part of the poetic computation awesomeness ðŸ«€ðŸ‘¾ ðŸŸ¨ ðŸŸª on artist Vera Molnar 

### Generative or Algorithmic Art goes back to the very earliest days of computer graphics and some of the key pioneers of this movement produced work before computer screens were even a thing. It was necessary for them to come up with a clear logic, program an algorithm, and hope for the best when the plotter spit out the results. Some of these earliest pioneers continue as a source of inspiration to algorithmic art to this day, and their early experiments continue to be useful for those learning to code or design algorithms to this day.

### One of these early pioneers is the French-Hungarian artist Vera MolnÃ¡r. She and other generative artists took important ideas from abstract art and Minimalism, which also flourished in the 1960s when many early experiments were done.
